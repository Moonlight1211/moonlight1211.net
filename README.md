    This is my website for development projects and other creations of mine that I want to be hosted on a website other than my `.com` one. The creation of this website arose most particularly from the fact that GitHub Pages doesn't support HTTPS for subdomains of websites with *apex domains* (Domains that do not have a subdomain; moonlight1211.com) This one will be less end-user accessible, and more intended for streamlinining development processes for myself and collaborators.
